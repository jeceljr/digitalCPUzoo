# RISC-V Wrappers

## [SERV by Olof Kindgren](https://github.com/olofk/serv)

a serial implementation trades off performance for small size by doing operations one bit at a time

## [Glacialby Eric Smith](https://github.com/brouhaha/glacial)

this 8 bit implementation uses microcode to execute 32 bit RISC-V instruction

## [Darkriscv by Marcelo Samsoniuk](https://github.com/darklife/darkriscv)

designed in a single night it is a very typical small RISC-V

## [PicoRV32 by Claire Xenia Wolf](https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32)

created to fit into small FPGAs this is a popular option for embedded systems

## [Vexriscv by Papon Charles](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv)

the SpinalHDL implementation offers many options, one of which is the exported Verilog used here
