# MCPU

This simple 8 bit processor by Tim BÃ¶scke only implements 4 instructions and
can address 64 bytes of memory. More information as well as VHDL and Verilog
implementations can be found in (https://github.com/cpldcpu/MCPU).

The instructions are:

| assembler | binary | operation |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| NOR addr  | 00?????? | Akku = ~(Akku | mem[addr]) |
| ADD addr  | 01?????? | Akku = Akku + mem[addr] |
| STA addr  | 10?????? | mem[addr] = Akku |
| JCC addr  | 11?????? | if carry == 0 then PC = addr; carry = 0 |

These instructions are defined as GNU AS macros in *mcpu.inc* so
an assembly program such as *gcd.S* which calculates the greatest
commond denominator can be assembled using the x86 version of as:

    as -a -o gcd.o gcd.S

where *gcd.S* includes *mcpu.inc*. The "-a" option creates a listing
on the terminal while "-o" selects a name different than a.out. The
next step is to convert the binary into a format that can be used
by the Digital simulator, such as Intel Hex:

    objcopy -S -O ihex gcd.o gcd.hex

The project *mcpu_bram.dig* uses an FPGA block RAM which complicates
the timing. Each instruction takes three clock cycles: fetch (F),
memory (M) and execute (E). The address must be supplied in the
previous clock cycle:

| signal | F | M | E | F | M | E | F | M | E |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Address| X |IR |PC | X |IR |PC | X |IR |PC |
| DataOut| I | X | D | I | X | D | I | X | D |

Most low end RAM chips are asynchronous and some FPGAs can disable the
internal registers of their BRAMs to have this behavior. Eliminating
the pipelining will reduce the maximum possible clock speed but it
will allow a version of the MCPU that only needs two clock cycles
per instruction:

| signal | F | E | F | E | F | E |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Address| PC | IR | PC | IR | PC | IR |
| DataOut| ...I | ...D | ...I | ...D | ...I | ...D |
