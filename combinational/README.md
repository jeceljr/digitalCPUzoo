#Combinational Circuits

Combinational circuits are those that have an output that depends exclusively on the different combinations of the inputs.

For circuits with two inputs there are only 4 possible input combinations: 0 and 0, 0 and 1, 1 and 0 as well as 1 and 1. Since different circuits can output either a 0 or a 1 in each case, this means we can only have 2^4 possible two input combinational circuits. 16 is a small enough number that we can show them all at once:

Using the "analysis" function of Digital we can verify that these 16 circuits are indeed all the possible 2 input combinational circuits.
